<h1 id="this-is-kinda-frustrating">This is kinda frustrating</h1>

<p>It’s taken me at <em>least</em> an hour to figure out why these posts aren’t working right with jekyll…but luckily, if you are viewing it, I have figured it out.</p>

<h2 id="right-now-this-is-where-my-programming-knowledge-is">Right now this is where my programming knowledge is.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>HTML - Basic knowledge. Can create simple static pages with standard tags.</li>
  <li>CSS - can create stylesheets and tie them back to my pages. This and HTML has come very naturally to me.</li>
  <li>Javascript - This is where I’m currently working. Can create variables, objects, loops, conditional statements, functions. Some simple DOM manipulation. Last night I created an application that tracks scores of players, Accepts a max score and allows players to reset their progress.</li>
  <li>Git process. How to operate git from the command line and how to manage files and branches.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-i-want-to-go-next">Where I wan’t to go next</h2>

<p>After my javascript module I plan to work on (roughly in this order)</p>

<ul>
  <li>jQuery</li>
  <li>NodeJS</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>MySql</li>
  <li>React.JS</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Rails</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Django</li>
</ul>

<p>I know it’s a lot to take in. I don’t necessarly want to become proficient in any of these languages right away, but I do want to at least get a little overview of how they work.</p>

<h2 id="how-im-learning">How I’m Learning</h2>

<p>Right now I’m following a UDEMY.com course “The Complete Web Developer Course” which is based around Node. I also have one based on Rails.</p>

<p>Lynda.com fills in the gaps in the material that UDEMY skips over.</p>

<p>After that I have the books.</p>

<p>Javascript for the absolute beginner is what I’m currently reading and it’s doing a good job of reinforcing stuff I have learned.</p>

<p>and <strong>finally</strong> YouTube.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been watching videos from Mackenzie Child (great for design as well as coding) and from DevTips.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope to update this with a post after every project…possibly every day I work on my courses…which at this rate is just about daily.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h3>

<p>It means there are going to be a LOT of posts. It means there is going to be a lot of bullshit. It means there will be spelling errors, shitty code, and utter confusion. But hopefully it will also mean there will be a lot of progress.</p>
