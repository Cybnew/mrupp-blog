<h1 id="thursday">Thursday</h1>

<p>Well…I stopped studying for a while. Bouncing mental images had me jumping from language to language. Well…I’m unemployed right now…so I need to make money. I am working on catching back up to where I was before I jumped off.</p>

<p>I’ve taken up following the Odin Project, so I will combine that with the courses I have on udemy…those will be the only two main sources for right now. Once I finish those I will try to apply for a local job as either a full-stack web developer or a front-end developer.</p>

<p>I will probably be making a few sites as a demonstration of my skills along the way.</p>

<p>Ideas I have for a projects?</p>

<ul>
  <li>A website that details the evolution of the Porche 911</li>
  <li>An E-Commerce Store</li>
  <li>A social based experience for motorcycle trips</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway…will continue to work on these ideas.</p>
