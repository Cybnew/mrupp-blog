<p>HOLY LIGHTSPEED BATMAN!</p>

<p>This week has been a blitz on the coursework…I know I havn’t updated this much…but I have been super deep in the learnings.</p>

<p>When last we left off I had just coded a front end “app” that was a basic todo list…which was awesome…but the todo’s were not persistant…well since then…guess what!?!?!</p>

<p>Are you thinking that now they might be persistant? If so than you are….</p>

<h2 id="wrong">Wrong!</h2>

<p>Yeah…I haven’t touched the todo list app since I published the last post…but here is what I have done…</p>

<p>I have set up a cloud9 IDE…I intend to install Node on a Raspberry pi at somepoint…but until then…cloud9 handles that hassle which lets me focus on the learning.</p>

<p>Tuesday…halloween…got a little done. Learned about Node.js and how it works on the serverside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Set up a Node environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Got some more practice using command line commands…I knew most of the ones the course covered…but it is good to get a refresher and some practice using them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learned about the express framework…and about NPM…and installing Node packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learned about Get requests…and routes…and how to serve info to routes….and how to use variables in them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learned about EJS…or embedded javascript…and how to use EJS to serve a variable to a template page…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of this has been fairly abstract…and while I feel I could fumble around with this and get a header to display a page name based on an imput in the URL field, I have a feeling it will really start to come together in the next few days so I can generate pages dynamically.</p>

<p>I know this is really rambly..but oh well.</p>
