<p>Well today I finally finished watching the solution video for the score counter. My solution was mostly spot on, however for styling of the winning characters, the course used a toggle function instead of setting the color in a style and resetting it to a specific color on reset.</p>

<p>Also learned about mousover and mouse leave to change the color on a hover state.</p>

<p>Key takeaways for me</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML is the structure</li>
  <li>CSS is the style</li>
  <li>Javascript is the actions</li>
</ul>

<p>NOUN ADJECTIVE VERB</p>

<p>So, when working on functionality, use HTML to build the frame, style it with CSS, and use javascript to manipulate the CSS instead of the HTML itself.</p>

<p>Also got a preview for the new project I will be working on. An RGB Color guessing game. Seems complex, but it has a lot of features I need to learn, such as responsive layout and more stylistic design.</p>
