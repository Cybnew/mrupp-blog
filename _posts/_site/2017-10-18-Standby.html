<h1 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h1>

<p>Slightly dead. Consumed by cold meds. Havn’t coded since monday. Head is foggy.</p>

<p>Plus side…playing around with illustrator…doodling..pretty fun.</p>

<p>Might post some doodles soon.</p>

<p>Thought of project I want to do, simple color scheme generator…with vector graphics being affected by color choices.</p>

<p>This is rambling….I know…how about a haiku?</p>

<p>Head cold has me sacked-
Sudafed has me loopy-
Time to not be sick.</p>
