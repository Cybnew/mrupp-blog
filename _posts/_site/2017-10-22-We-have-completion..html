<p>It took all damn week but I am finally over the stupid cold I had. Being sick really took it out of me this week, so I pretty much avoided anything programming related beyond a youtube video or two.. But…since I am FINALLY feeling better, I figured I would dig deep into the rest of the basic javascript section. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Well…I finally finished the RGB color guessing game from the Udemy Course. It usually takes me about 35 minutes to complete a 15 minute video. Usually it’s because I pause it right before the instructor explains it, and I try to figure it out for myself. I have mixed feelings on the benifits of this.</p>

<p>A. It gets me thinking about how to solve the problem…which is good. I have gotten in the habit of separating my code out (I guess it counts as refactoring) before the instructor finishes explaining a way to solve the problem.</p>
<ol>
  <li>But it gets me pointed down a path (branch?) that diverts from the course, which is fine…but if the course takes a slightly different direction, it takes me for forever to redirect my code towards the solution. Urg.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tonight things went pretty damn well up until the final refactoring. I spent 21 minutes searching for what happened to be a comma that escapted the file…I could have sworn it was there when I started. Unfortunately, while I was searching for what turned out to be a missing comma, Katy was busy searching through her sewing patterns…we learned that I don’t focus well with crinkling craft paper in the background. <strong>looks at Katy</strong></p>

<p>Anyway. RGB game is finished. If you want to check it out you can click the link below.
