<h1 id="monday">Monday</h1>

<p>Well..this weekend was long and full of terrors…</p>

<h2 id="fact-the-days-of-24-hour-video-game-playing-has-passed-no-longer-am-i-able-to-withstand-the-clocks-torment-as-the-seconds-turn-to-minutes-and-the-minutes-turn-to-hours">Fact: The days of 24 hour video game playing has passed. No longer am I able to withstand the clock’s torment as the seconds turn to minutes, and the minutes turn to hours.</h2>
<p>This weekend Katy hosted a 24 hour video game livestream for the ExtraLife organization. The goal was to raise money for childrens hospitals…and that involved us playing video games for 24 hours. I was not required to participate…but I did so anyway…well..for 22.5 of them…I ended up taking an hour and a half nap….totally worth it.</p>

<p>Anyway…with the livestream requiring a hefty amount of setup, I was not able to study friday-sunday….so I accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>Today I could barely suffer through a few lessons…but did learn about post requests. I was able to code along and make a page that updates with information from a text box….dont know if I could do it from memory…but I could figure it out I think.</p>

<p>Tomorrow…we go deeper.</p>
